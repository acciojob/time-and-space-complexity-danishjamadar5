	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. In other words, it measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. An algorithm with lower time complexity is more efficient because it completes its task in a shorter amount of time, making it suitable for large datasets and real-time applications.</p>
<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to perform its task as a function of the input size. This is particularly important in situations where memory resources are limited. A common notation used to describe space complexity is 'O(n),' where 'n' represents the input size. The 'O(n)' notation signifies that the space required by the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration when designing algorithms to ensure optimal memory usage and avoid memory-related issues.</p>
